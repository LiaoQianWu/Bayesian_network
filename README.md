## Bayesian network

This work includes biological data processing using, e.g., [deepTools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/#) and causal network structure inference using R package [*bnlearn*](https://www.bnlearn.com). We took advantage of data generated from HCT116 and DKO1 cell lines from [Lay et al., 2015](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/4/467.full.html) and some other sources since HCT116 can be used as observational data to ensure a causal network is active and DKO1 can be used as so-called interventional data to improve the directionality of the edges.
